eXcel Tuition Centre Management System
-----------
eXcel Tuition Centre is one of the fast-growing tuition Centre in Malaysia that employed tens of tutor to conduct tuition classes on all the school subjects in their various Tuition Centers. All the tutors are paid by hourly rate ranged from RM40.00 – RM80.00, depends on the subject they teach. Tutors can be rated by the students on their teaching performance with a scale rating from 1-5, where 1 is “very poor performance” and 5 is “excellent performance”. The tuition Centre needs a system to store information about their tutors (identified by Tutor ID, Name, Date Joined, Date Terminated, Hourly Rate, Phone, Address, Tuition Centre Code, Tuition Center Name, Subject Code, Subject Name, Rating [a single digit integer number ranging from 1 to 5]). To maintain quality and consistency, one tutor is allowed to teach on the subject in their specialized field only.

Tuition Centres are located in various locations and each of the Tuition Centre is managed by an admin staff. All the tutors’ record are managed and maintained by the Tuition Centre Head Quarter Human Resources Department. The current filing system of records is by categorizing the tutors by their respective location. i.e. all tutors’ records are filed together in the tuition centre location. In each location, the tutor’s records are filed alphabetically by the tutor’s name. The main problem with this filing system is when searching for a record, the record could not be easily found as it might have been misplaced in another Tuition Centre or the record is not placed in the correct alphabet sequence. This problem proves challenging for the Tuition Center admin staff when wanting to retrieve a tutor’s record quickly. When a tutor terminated his tutoring service, the record for that tutor will be destroyed 6 months after the termination.

At the end of each week, a report is generated to list all tutors of the Tuition Center to keep track of the available vacancy for new tutors.

The admin manager of the tuition center has decided that it is time to computerize the records of Tutors serving in the Tuition Center due to the problems with the manual filling system. Since you have some knowledge in developing a computerized system, the Tuition Center HR Manager has approaches you to assist them in developing the system.
